//JS statements are ACTIONS we tell Javascript to perform
//change this content, update or add this, change the look of that

//using the console for testing
console.log("Hello World!");

//STRINGS are pieces of text and must alway go WITHIN quotes

//conversely, NUMBERS do not go within quotes
console.log(4 + 5);
//Numbers allows you to do math stuff like seeing if something is less than something else

//simple variables
//variables are temporary holders of data - it can change depending on conditions that we set in the code
let animal;

//we give variables a VALUE when we want them to hold something
animal = "unicorn";
animal = "platypus";
//variables also don't have quotes when we want to use them - although their values can
console.log(animal);
//we can overwrite or set an NEW VALUE to a pre-existing variable
//when we do so, we don't use the keyword var again
animal = "minotaur";
//as you can see what is printed out to the console the second time is different because we changed the value of the variable

//CONCATENATION - This is the fancy coding word for 'adding things together'. Not in a math sense but adding bit of text or values together
//for example, what is we want to pring to the console "My favourite animal is [and whatever is in the animal variable"
console.log("My favorite animal is " + animal);
//We aren't bound to just putting stuff in the console!!! This is a great way to test and debug and find errors

//Changing the DOM - Document Object Model
//We can change the content on ANY element on a page with it's ID
//we use the JavaScript METHOD getElementById() to select something
//We use the PROPERTY .innerHTML to state that we want to change the HTML that is inside of it

//We can change more than just the content! We can change the looks
document.getElementById("column1").innerHTML =
  "<h3>Wow!</h3> <p>This is AMAZING!!</p> ";
document.getElementById("column1").innerHTML += "<p>I am such a genius!</p>";
document.getElementById("column1").innerHTML +=
  "<img class='img-fluid' src='images/code.jpg'>";
//This time we will add the id 'column2' to the next column over and then change the css of it!
//we will select it by the id
//Then use the .style to say we want to change the css of it and then state which property we want to change
document.getElementById("column2").style.color = "red";
document.getElementById("column2").style.fontSize = "60pt";
//LOGIC!
document.getElementById("column2").style.backgroundColor = "#0e2549";

//THE MOST powerful aspect about any kind of coding is that we can use logic to create a custom interaction with the user
//This means we can give the browser instructions on what to do depending on something else
//For example, in a game, perhaps you can pick up a better weapon, which in turn causes more damage
//So the amount of damage points is BASED on which weapon is being used

//we will create a variable that holds the 'weapon' that the user has
if (animal == "minotaur") {
  console.log("Your battle with the minotaur");
} else {
  console.log("You go for a picnic!");
}
//Then we will print out content to the page depending on which weapon they have
//This is LOGIC
//we will use an 'IF STATEMENT' to change the message they receive based on the variable holding the weapon
let weapon = "Fists";
//if the weapon equals fists
//then chnage the innerHTML of column3 to say "<p>you are using fists"
//else if the weapon equals Squids
//then give them a different message
//otherwise (else)
//then give them a different message
//if(){}else if(){}{}
if (weapon == "Fists") {
  document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>You are using fists </p>";
} else if (weapon == "Squids") {
  document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML +=
    "<p>you are using something else </p>";
} else {
  document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML +=
    "<p>your weapon doesnt work here </p>";
}

let damage = 0;
//Let's take it a step further and say the opponent has a health of 100 points
if (weapon == "Fists") {
  damage = 5;
} else if (weapon == "Squids") {
  damage = 10;
} else {
  damage = 0;
}

console.log(damage);

//change content in the 3rd column
document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML +=
  weapon + " have damage of: " + damage;

//Send a message to column3 with what the opponent's health is

//then we will define damage points for each type of weaapon

//use the console to test is the damage variable is working correctly
let health = 100;

//Let's change column3 and send the user a message
//CONCATENTATE the 'weapon' name and the STRING ' have this much damage: ' and then the 'damage' amount
document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML +=
  "<p>Opponent Health: " + health + "</p>";

//Now let's say the user has hit the opponent with their weapon
//We need to MINUS the 'damage' from the opponents 'health'

//then send the message with the new 'health' value

//Hit them AGAIN and send the new health message

//then send the message with the new 'health' value
health = health - damage;

document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML +=
  "<p>Opponent Health: " + health + "</p>";
